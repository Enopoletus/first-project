<h1>How to edit the dislikes</h1>
  <p>1. Get <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/dlwiz/?type=bin&os=Win32&flav=-&ver=*">curl</a> working on your computer (if it's not already). If you're on Windows 10, install bash.exe by installing a Linux Distro in the Windows 10 store.</p>
  <p>2. Open the Chrome Dev Tools to the Network tab. Dislike a post. 
  <p>3. Copy the HTTP POST request via right-click-->Copy-->Copy as cUrl.</p>
  <p>4. Copy that into the bash. Edit with arrow keys, backspace key, and keyboard at will.</p>
  <p>5. The copied cUrl works as thus: <br><code>%5C</code> is \<br><code>%22</code> is "<br><code>%2C</code> is ,<br><code>%3A</code> is :<br>
    <code>%7D</code>is }<br><code>%5D</code> is ]
  <p>6. The number of dislikes in a post is the number listed after <code>{\"n\":</code></p>
