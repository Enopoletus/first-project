<h1>How to edit the dislikes</h1>
  <p>1. <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads"> Download git</a> (size: 252MB). Open the git bash.</p>
  <p>2. Open the Chrome Dev Tools to the Network tab. Dislike a post. 
  <p>3. Copy the HTTP POST request via right-click-->Copy-->Copy as cUrl (bash).</p>
  <p>4. Paste that into the bash. Edit with arrow keys, backspace key, and keyboard at will.</p>
  <p>5. The copied request body works as thus: <br><code>%5C</code> is \<br><code>%22</code> is "<br><code>%2C</code> is ,<br><code>%3A</code> is :<br>
    <code>%7D</code> is }<br><code>%5D</code> is ]
  <p>6. The number of dislikes in a post is the number listed after <code>{\"n\":</code></p>
  <p>7. If the number of dislikes for a post is stated as a nonsensical number (such as one beginning with a zero, though not zero itself), the entire dislike plugin will break for the page the post is in.</p>
  <p>8. The number of dislikes to be added (or subtracted) for a poster is the number listed after <code>[value]=</code>
   after the Shorty dislike key is introduced. Whether that number is to be added or subtracted from a poster's total number of dislikes 
    is determined by whether increment or decrement is stated in the HTTP POST request. Yes, a poster can have a negative number of dislikes.</p>
