<h1>How to edit the dislikes</h1>
  <p>1. Get curl working on your computer (if it's not already). If you're on Windows 10, install bash.exe by installing a Linux Distro in the Windows 10 store.</p>
  <p>2. Open the Chrome Dev Tools to the Network tab. Dislike a post a couple of times. 
  <p>3. Copy the HTTP POST request via right-click-->Copy-->Copy as cUrl.</p>
  <p>4. Copy that into the bash. Edit with arrow keys, delete key, and keyboard at will. What parts to edit are self-evident and are left as an exercise for the reader.</p>
